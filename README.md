Applied Data Science Capstone


- Business Understanding :

The main goal of this project is to collect and analyze data in order to select a location in Sydney to open a Cafeteria. 
We want to help a business owner planning to open up a Cafe in a location by exploring better facilities around the Suburb.


-Analytical Approach:

This is an unsupervised machine learning problem where we need to group together suburbs having similar facilities. 
We will use K Means Clustering to solve this problem.
