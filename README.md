Applied Data Science Capstone


- Business Understanding :

The main goal of this project is to collect and analyze data in order to select a location in Sydney to open a Cafeteria. 
We want to help a business owner planning to open up a Cafe in a location by exploring better facilities around the Suburb.


- Analytical Approach:

This is an unsupervised machine learning problem where we need to group together suburbs having similar facilities. 
We can use K Means Clustering to solve this problem.


- Data Understanding :

The Wikipedia page contains a list of suburbs in Melbourne. There are 329 suburbs in Sydney,Australia which I extracted using a web scraping technique with the help of Python BeautifulSoup and Request packages.
the geographical coordinates such as latitude and longitude of each suburb were collected using Pythonâ€™s Geocoder package.
Then, Foursquare API was used to extract details about the various venues present in each suburb.
Once, the location data was extracted by using Geocoder, I used the Folium package to visualize the data on a map. This ensured us that the data we retrieved was correct. Foursquare API was used to obtain the top 100 venues within a radius of 2000 meters.

- Data Requirements:
We would need a list of suburbs, the location of each suburb, and how many cafes are present in the suburb.

- Data Collection:

- List of Suburbs in Sydney, Australia which I have extracted from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Suburbs_of_Sydney
- Latitude & Longitude of all the suburbs using Geocoder
- venues in each suburb from foursquare API https://foursquare.com/
